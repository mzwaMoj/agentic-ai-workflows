    "# Building a Basic Chatbot with Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the way we interact with technology, making it possible to create sophisticated conversational AI with relative ease. This notebook will guide you through the fundamental steps of building a basic chatbot using Azure OpenAI's powerful language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will cover:\n",
    "- **Setting up the environment:** How to configure your credentials to connect to the Azure OpenAI service.\n",
    "- **Creating an Azure OpenAI Client:** Initializing the client to interact with the API.\n",
    "- **Making API Calls:** Sending prompts to the model and receiving responses.\n",
    "- **Streaming Responses:** Implementing real-time, token-by-token responses for a more interactive experience.\n",
    "- **Building a Simple Chat Function:** Encapsulating the logic into a reusable function.\n",
    "- **Understanding Limitations:** Exploring the inherent limitations of a basic chatbot, such as lack of memory and real-time data access.\n",
    "- **Exploring Solutions:** Briefly touching upon advanced techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), fine-tuning, and tool calling to overcome these limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will have a functional chatbot and a solid understanding of the core concepts required to build more advanced conversational AI applications. Let's get started!"

      "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions. Instead of being programmed for specific functions, machine learning systems learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions based on the information they have processed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key components of machine learning include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Data**: Machine learning relies on large datasets to train models. These datasets can be labeled (supervised learning) or unlabeled (unsupervised learning).\n",

      "2. **Algorithms**: Various algorithms are used to train models, including linear regression, decision trees, neural networks, support vector machines, and clustering algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Training and Testing**: The model is trained on a portion of the dataset (training set) and validated on another portion (test set) to evaluate its performance and ability to generalize to new, unseen data.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Features**: Features are individual measurable properties or characteristics used as input to the machine learning model. Feature selection and engineering are critical for improving model performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Types of Learning**:\n",
      "   - **Supervised Learning**: The model is trained on labeled data, learning to map inputs to outputs based on provided examples (e.g., classification and regression tasks).\n",
      "   - **Unsupervised Learning**: The model learns from unlabelled data, identifying patterns and structures (e.g., clustering and association).\n",
      "   - **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions, aiming to maximize cumulative reward.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Applications**: Machine learning is widely used across various domains, including finance (fraud detection), healthcare (diagnosis), marketing (customer segmentation), autonomous vehicles, natural language processing, and image recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the goal of machine learning is to enable systems to improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data, making them increasingly effective at tackling complex problems and tasks.None\n"
